    <h4>1. No Spam / Advertising / Self-promote in the forums</h4>
    <p class="lead">These forums define spam as unsolicited advertisement for goods, services and/or other web sites, or
        posts with little, or completely unrelated content. Do not spam the forums with links to your site or product,
        or try to self-promote your website, business or forums etc.
        Spamming also includes sending private messages to a large number of different users.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning text-center" role="alert">
        DO NOT ASK for email addresses or phone numbers
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Your account will be banned permanently and your posts will be deleted.</p>

    <h4>2. Do not post copyright-infringing material</h4>
    <p class="lead">Providing or asking for information on how to illegally obtain copyrighted materials is forbidden.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Do not post “offensive” posts, links or images</h4>
    <p class="lead">Any material which constitutes defamation, harassment, or abuse is strictly prohibited. Material
        that is sexually or otherwise obscene, racist, or otherwise overly discriminatory is not permitted on these
        forums. This includes user pictures. Use common sense while posting.
        This is a web site for accountancy professionals.</p>

    <h4>4. Do not cross post questions</h4>
    <p class="lead"> Please refrain from posting the same question in several forums. There is normally one forum which
        is most suitable
        in which to post your question.</p>

    <h4> 5. Do not PM users asking for help</h4>
    <p class="lead">Do not send private messages to any users asking for help. If you need help, make a new thread in
        the appropriate
        forum then the whole community can help and benefit.</p>

    <h4>6. Remain respectful of other members at all times</h4>
    <p class="lead">All posts should be professional and courteous. You have every right to disagree with your fellow
        community membersand explain your perspective.
        <br>
        However, you are not free to attack, degrade, insult, or otherwise belittle them or the quality of this
        community.
        It does not matter what title or power you hold in these forums, you are expected to obey this rule.
    </p>

    <h2 class="my-4">General Posting Guidelines</h2>
    <p class="lead"> We figured this was necessary because a lot of people come in and post threads without thinking,
        and without
        realizing that there is no possible way they could get help because of the way they posted the question. Here
        are
        some general guidelines.</p>

    <h4>1. Please use SEARCH first!search_box</h4>
    <p class="lead"> There is a pretty good chance that unless you have some really odd or unique problem that it has
        been addressed on our forum before, please use the forum’s search feature first to see if there are already some
        good threads on thesubject. It’s easy to search – just click the “Search” button at the top right of the page.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Be DESCRIPTIVE and Don’t use “stupid” topic names</h4>
    <p class="lead"> PLEASE post a descriptive topic name! Give a short summary of your problem IN THE SUBJECT.
        (Don’tuse attention getting subjects, they don’t get attention and only annoy people).</p>

    <div class="alert alert-warning text-center" role="alert">
        Here’s a great list of topic subjects YOU SHOULD NOT POST :
        Help me, Hello, Very urgent, I have a question

    </div>

    <p class="lead"> Generally ANYTHING similar to those is unacceptable. Just post your problem.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning text-center" role="alert">
        Remember when people help you, they are doing YOU a favor
    </div>

    <p class="lead"> Be patient, help people out by posting good descriptions of what you need help with, and not
        snapping at people with
        garbage such as <br>
        “if you aren’t going to help don’t waste my time replying”.</p>
